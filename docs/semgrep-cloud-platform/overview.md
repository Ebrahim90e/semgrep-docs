Semgrep's **Cloud Platform (SCP)** is a web application that allows you to manage and orchestrate Code, Supply Chain, and Secrets. You can automate the continous scanning of your projects with Semgrep's products, as well as modify the way Semgrep scans your code for security issues to better support your business and security goals.

The Cloud Platform also includes the following features to support you throughout the entire software development life cycle:

In addition to pushing comments to your pull request or merge requst, Semgrep can send you Slack notifications or emails, post JSON alerts to the endpoint of your choice, as well as automatically create Asana, Jira, or Linear tickets for follow-up;
* **Rules writing tools** to help you customize your scans;
* **User management and collaboration features** for rules writing, findings triage, and issue remediation.
