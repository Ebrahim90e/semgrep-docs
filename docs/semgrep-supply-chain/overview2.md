# Overview

<SscIntro />


Supply Chain allows you to detect [security vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/news/change-timeline) in your project's open-source dependencies and determine if they are [reachable](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#reachability).

Supply Chain parses lock files for a list of dependencies used by your project, then scans your codebase using **rules** that define:

* The package versions that contain the vulnerability;
* A pattern that describes the vulnerable code (e.g., how unsanitized code is passed in);
* The severity of the vulnerability.

Supply Chain generates a **finding** whenever it detects that your code includes a dependency whose version contains a vulnerability. If Supply Chain also finds the matching code within your codebase, the finding is **reachable**; if not, the finding is **unreachable**.

If Supply Chain detects a match for the dependency that's within the vulnerable version range, but it does *not* have a reachability for the vulnerability, then the finding is **undetermined** (this is most common with older or lower severity vulnerabilities). Rules that exclude reachability analysis are called [lockfile-only](/semgrep-supply-chain/glossary/#lockfile-only-rules)** rules. They're generated by checking the dependency's version in the lock/manifest file against the versions with known vulnerabilities.

## View findings in Cloud Platform

You can find all Supply Chain findings in the Cloud Platform.

Semgrep calls specific findings for a given dependency with matching code found in your project **usages**. In the Cloud Platfornm, usages are grouped by their **vulnerability type**; typically, each one is listed alongside its corresponding [CVE](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview) number.

The Cloud Platform also includes a list of advisories for your reference. Advisories include all of the vulnerabilities covered by Supply Chain, regardless of whether your code includes the dependency.
