Semgrep Code is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that inspects your application for security vulnerabilities.

## Rules

<SemgrepScan />

In addition to the default rules (available in the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r)), you can write custom rules to determine how Semgrep scans your code. Regardless of whether you use with Semgrep's default rules or write custom rules, knowing *which* rules Semgrep ran against your code helps you understanding how Code detected security issues.

## Findings

Semgrep displays findings identified by Code in the Cloud Platform.
