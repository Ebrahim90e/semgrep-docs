Learn how to set up Semgrep, scan your first project for security issues, and view your findings.

1. Navigate to [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/login), and sign up by clicking on **Sign in with GitHub** or **Sign in with GitLab**. Follow the on-screen prompts to grant Semgrep the needed permissions and proceed.

2. Provide the **Organization display name** you'd like to use, and click **Create new organization** to proceed.

3. Launch your CLI, and follow the instructions displayed on the **Scan a project on your machine** page. Ensure that you're working in the root of your project repo.

4. Click **View findings** to see what security vulnerabilities exist in your project.

5. Semgrep displays all of your Code (SAST) and Supply Chain (SCA) findings in the Cloud Platform. The Cloud Platform homepage for your org displays high-level summary statistics, but you can click **Code** to access your SAST findings or **Supply Chain** to access your SCA findings.
