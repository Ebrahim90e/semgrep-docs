# project-depends-on

Under this key, third-party dependencies can be specified along with the semver (semantic version) range that the rule should trigger for. `project-depends-on` filters the rule unless one of the children is matched by a lockfile. 

We welcome external contributors to try out the key, but keep in mind there's no expectation of stability across releases yet.

The `project-depends-on` key must specify either a dependency, or a sequence of dependencies under a `depends-on-either` key.

A dependency consists of three keys:

* `namespace`: The package registry where the third party dependency is found
* `package`: The name of the third party dependency as it appears in the lockfile
* `version`: A semantic version range. Uses [Python packaging specifiers](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/specifiers.html) which support almost all NPM operators, except `^`

So a `project-depends-on` key will either look like this:
```yaml
project-depends-on:
  namespace: ...
  package: ...
  version: ...
```
or this:
```yaml
project-depends-on:
  depends-on-either:
    - namespace: ...
      package: ...
      version: ...
    - namespace: ...
      package: ...
      version: ...
    ...
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example `project-depends-on` rule that looks for a known vulnerable version of the AWS CLI from April 2017, but only reports the vulnerability if the `s3` module (where the vulnerability is located) is actually being used:

```yaml
rules:
- id: vulnerable-awscli-apr-2017
  pattern-either:
  - pattern: boto3.resource('s3', ...)
  - pattern: boto3.client('s3', ...)
  project-depends-on:
    namespace: pypi
    package: awscli
    version: "<= 1.11.82"
  message: this version of awscli is subject to a directory traversal vulnerability in the s3 module
  languages: [python]
```

## Supported Languages

| Language   | Namespace  | Scans dependencies from          |
|:---------- |:-----------|:---------------------------------|
| Python     | pypi       | `Pipfile.lock`                   |
| JavaScript | npm        | `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` |
| Java       | maven      | `pom.xml`                        |
| Go         | gomod      | `go.sum`                         |
| Ruby       | gem        | `Gemfile.lock`                   |
| Rust       | cargo      | `cargo.lock`                     |

## Limitations

* Dependency resolution uses the source of dependency information with the *least amount of ambiguity* available. For all supported languages except Java, this is a lockfile, which lists exact version information for each dependency that a project uses. We do not scan, for example, `package.json` files, because they can contain version ranges. In the case of Java, Maven does not support the creation of lockfiles, so `pom.xml` is the least ambiguous source of information we have, and we consider only dependencies listed with exact versions.
