To ensure that your GitHub repository is **detected** by Semgrep Cloud Platform:

1. Log into GitHub.
2. If you're using a **personal** account, go to [**Settings > Applications**](https://github.com/settings/installations). If you're using an org account, navigate to the following URL (ensure that you've replaced the placeholder with your org name): `https://github.com/organizations/NAME_OF_ORG/settings/installations`
3. Find **semgrep-app**, and click **Configure**.
4. Under **Repository access**, select an option to provide Semgrep access:
    1. **All repositories** will display all current and future public and private repositories.
    2. **Only select repositories** will display explicitly selected repositories.
