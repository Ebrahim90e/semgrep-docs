To ensure that your GitHub repository is **detected** by the Cloud Platform:

1. Ensure that you've added GitHub as a source code manager; if not, you can do so by navigating to the **[<i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/)**, click **Source code managers > Connect to GitHub**.
2. Log into GitHub and navigate to your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
3. Under **Integrations** (located on the left-hand navigation bar), click **Applications**.
4. Next to **semgrep-app**, click **Configure**.
5. Under **Repository access**, select one of the following access options:
    1. **All repositories**: enables Cloud Platform to detect all of your public and private repositories.
    2. **Only select repositories**: enables Cloud Platform to detect only the specified public and private repositories
